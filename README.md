# AltinnLibrary

A package used for authenticating, getting RF-1030 forms and attaching a RF-1189 form through Altinn.

More features maybe added later. This is library depends on Alamofire for networking and AEXML library for manipulating XML. If any of these libraries change that may break this project.
